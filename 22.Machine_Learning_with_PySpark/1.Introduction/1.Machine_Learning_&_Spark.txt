##                  Characteristics of Spark                  ##
Spark is currently the most popular technology for processing large quantities of data. 
Not only is it able to handle enormous data volumes, but it does so very efficiently too! Also, unlike some other distributed computing technologies, developing with Spark is a pleasure.


Which of these describe Spark?

A) Spark is a framework for cluster computing.
B) Spark does most processing in memory.
C) Spark has a high-level API, which conceals a lot of complexity.
D) All of the above

Answer: D




##                  Components in a Spark Cluster                  ##
Spark is a distributed computing platform. It achieves efficiency by distributing data and computation across a cluster of computers.

A Spark cluster consists of a number of hardware and software components which work together.


Which of these is not part of a Spark cluster?

Answer: A load balancer
A load balancer distributes work across multiple resources, preventing overload on any one resource. In Spark this function is performed by the cluster manager.
