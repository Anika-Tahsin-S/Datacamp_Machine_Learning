##                   Experimenting with model structures                  ##
You've just run an experiment where you compared two networks that were identical except that the 2nd network had an extra hidden layer. You see that this 2nd network (the deeper network) had better performance. Given that, which of the following would be a good experiment to run next for even better performance?

Answer: Use more units in each hidden layer.

Increasing the number of units in each hidden layer would be a good next step to try achieving even better performance.
