##                   Describing Keras                  ##
Which of the following statements about Keras is false?
A) Keras is integrated into TensorFlow, that means you can call Keras from within TensorFlow and get the best of both worlds.
B) Keras can work well on its own without using a backend, like TensorFlow.
C) Keras is an open source project started by Fran√ßois Chollet.

Answer: B; Keras is a wrapper around a backend library, so a backend like TensorFlow, Theano, CNTK, etc must be provided.

# Imagine you're building an app that allows you to take a picture of your clothes and then shows you a pair of shoes that would match well. This app needs a machine learning module that's in charge of identifying the type of clothes you are wearing, as well as their color and texture.
# Would you use deep learning to accomplish this task?
# Answer: I'd use deep learning since we are dealing with unstructured data and neural networks work well with images.
# Using deep learning would be the easiest way. The model would generalize well if enough clothing images are provided.
